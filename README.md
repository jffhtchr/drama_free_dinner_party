Imagine you are hosting an event and you need to fit a bunch of people into a room to eat dinner. There are two things you must figure out. 1) For a given number of guests, how can you arrange the tables/chairs/misc furniture in a rectangular room that is X feet wide by Y feet long so that everyone fits comfortably? 2) How can you generate a seating chart to to minimize awkward conversation/ fights so that everyone is happy?
